        <h3> <STROng> The Story</STROng></h3>
            <p>In September of 2019 Rick decided to turn his fashion for photography into a full-time business and kicked it off in the <br>
                very beginninng of 2020. Bringing the very strong business skills he learned working in the corporate world to bare, he quickly <br>
                grew the business to be recognized competitior and well established business in the local market. Along the way adding to his many<br>
                skills out of necessity. Rick quickly realized that even if he had the best photography in the world, it wouldn't matter if no one<br>
                ever noticed his work. So, he set about trying to find an SEO company to improve his rankings for a 
                <a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=dallas+photographer&oq=dallas+photographer&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0i512j69i61j69i65l2j69i61l2.5351j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8>Google search.</a> This decision would<br>
                eventually lead to the decision to start learnig to code and forming his on web development, SEO and marketing company, DFW Pro SEO.<br>
            <br>
                "I ended up firing two seperate organizations I had hired for unethical behaviour and a sever lack of performance. They were quite literally<br>
                stealing my money. This is when I recognized a extreme need for an ethical company in this market built on integrity, transparency and<br>
                communication. Almost any entrepeneur you speak with has an SEO comany horror story. So, since I couldn't find a good company to hire, I started<br>
                to do it myslef and eventually built my own to serve others.

         <h3>My Resume</h3>
            <p>You really could say I am somewhat of a jack of all trades. Mostly because of my insatiable appetite for knowledge and to learn. WHen you combine that with my seemingly endless curiosity,<br>
                then you have the right combination for someone that will learn a lot, about a lot of things. Then when you add in a little intense interest, focus and passion on a few specific subjects, <br>
                you have someone who will master what he is really interested in, that's me in a nutshell. Add to that that I am a very hard worker with grit who always wants to be the best at what I do and <br>
                the fact that I will not do something for long I do not have a passion for and then you have a recipe for success.<br>
